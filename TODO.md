Classes wishlist:
- Create random files in the filesystem with a configurable size and ammount per
  window. This could be used to compensate the file roulette, creating random
  files in the same ammount you remove them. At least, you will end up with the
  same ammount of files.

- Ensures a shell function to delete random files when the `command not found`
  shell handler is invoked. Use custom profile to ensure it.
